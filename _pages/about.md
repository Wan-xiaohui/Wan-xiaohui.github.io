Xiaohui Wan is currently pursuing a PhD at the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, located at Beihang University in Beijing, China. His research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE), encompassing AI techniques for SE and software quality assurance (SQA) techniques for AI software. In recent years, he has published some papers in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), IEEE Transactions on Reliability (TRel), IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing (TETC), Journal of Systems and Software (JSS), Software Quality Journal (SQJ), and International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE'19 regular paper). His publications involve machine learning-based software defect prediction approaches, as well as testing and fault tolerance approaches for AI software.
